		<div class="section">The most popular form of reading memory from the game is finding the modules base address
			then using a static offset to the desired memory location. The problem with this is when
			changes are made to the DLL, most offsets will 'shift' as the new code is put into the binary.
			Now all of those static offsets are changed and no longer work.
		  <br />
			<br />
			However there is a technique called "Byte Signature Scanning" that can help you find
			your desired memory location without using static memlocs by "scanning" for it. This
			The idea is to scan over the binaries actual CODE, and look for a specific pattern of
			code that references your desired memory location that doesnt occur anywhere else in the
			binary. <br /><br />

			For Example:<br />
			<textarea name="textarea" rows="7" readonly="true">05AB51D7   8338 60          	CMP DWORD PTR DS:[EAX],60
05AB51DA   75 0E            	JNZ SHORT Game.05AB51EA
05AB51DC   6A 00            	PUSH 0
05AB51DE   E8 5DFA0C00      	CALL Game.05B84C40
05AB51E3   83C4 04          	ADD ESP,4
05AB51E6   84C0             	TEST AL,AL
05AB51E8   74 07            	JE SHORT Game.05AB51F1
05AB51EA   C605 4C96E105 00 	MOV BYTE PTR DS:[5E1964C],0</textarea>
			<br />
<br /><br />
			Every time the game loads, this same exact code will likely still be in the binary
			(unless the patch changed this specific code), and will be referencing the exact memory
			location i'm wanting to access.

			If you don't understand assembly, its ok, i'll give a brief overview of this data.
			The first column you can ignore, that was the memory addresses those instructions were at
			at the time of this paste. The 2nd column is the ACTUAL instructions/code in the binary.
			The 3rd column is just a textual representation of what those instructions are doing so you can
			read it easier if you program in assembly. On the last line you can see its moving a value of 0
			into a byte, and the [5E1964C] is the address its storing to, and thats what I want.
			On the left hand side you can see that address is in the actual code too (note: hex is stored
			in reverse order in memory. This is what we are scanning for, the bytes in the middle column,
			up until the desired memory location (0x4C96E105). So instead of a static address, we can for the
			code and pull the memory address we want out of that data. From a 3rd party perspecive you can now
			use ReadProcessMemory on that address, or from an internal perspective, create a pointer to that address.<br />
			This greatly will increase the likelyhood your application will still work after the module is updated.

			<h2>Function Details</h2>

<div class="h3">
					<a name="2.details.initializesigscan"> </a>
					<h3>InitializeSigScan( DWORD PID, const char* Module)</h3>
					The first parameter is a 32bit unsigned integer, supplying the Process ID you are
					wanting to read, and the module to find a memory address in.<br /><br />
					This function will connect to the process, find the base address, and if the process is a not the current process, copy the entire module to your programs
					local memory. This is required to achieve high speeds of scanning the memory, as doing it over
					ReadProcessMemory would be drastically slow.<br /><br />
				</div>
				<div class="h3">
					<a name="2.details.sigscan"> </a>
					<h3>SigScan(const char* Pattern, int Offset)</h3>
					This is the primary function of the DLL, that does the actual scanning. You MUST call InitializeSigScan before using this function.
					It will automatically scan the last Process and Module initialized with InitializeSigScan().
					This function accepts a string ascii based pattern of bytes. You must supply 2 characters per byte
					to check for as you normally would define as 0xXX. If its a single 0xF, you need "0f". So the strings length must be divisible by 2,
					where every 2 characters represents 1 byte.<br /><br />
					Example: "83C408DFE0F6C4050F8A610100005FC605"<br />
					This will look for: 0x83 0xC4 0x08 0xDF 0xE0 0xF6 0xC4 0x05 0x0F 0x8A 0x61 0x01 0x00 0x00 0x5F 0xC6 0x05<br />
					By default, SigScan will use the next 4 bytes AFTER the end of the signature as the memory address you are wanting to find.<br />
					The Offset field is computed into this predefined location. So in most cases Offset should be 0. However, if you find a signature
					thats like 36 bytes before your desired memory location, you can set offset to 36 and it will look at 36 bytes AFTER the end of the signature.
					Offset will primarily be 0 in your scans, but is provided to you so you can use signatures a little more distant from the desired location
					without creating an insanely long signature or using a ton of wildcards.<br /><br />

					There are 2 special characters that can be used in the pattern, one is address specification.
					As stated, by default the memory address it will return is at the end of the signature. But sometimes you may want to use a few bytes AFTER your
					desired memory location as part of your signature. If you wish to do this, you can specify WHERE in your signature your desired
					memory location is at with XXXXXXXX, <br />
					For example (not a real signature!): "3FBACD300200A1XXXXXXXXB1C4DA"<br />
					Now the position of the X's declares where the memory address is. Offset should be 0 when using this, as offset will modify the position,
					and will not returned your desired memory location!!!<br /><br />
					Any unkown character such as ? and invalid hex characters are treated as wildcards, but still must be matched up in 2's.<br />
					For example (not a real signature!): "3AB2DFAB????????DEA1FA"<br />
					Sometimes the middle of your signature may have other unwanted memory addresses in them, and you need to wildcard those out to skip them.
					Wildcard anything that will potentially be different every time the game opens - that includes ALL memory addresses that you are not trying
					to retrieve, otherwise your signature will not be valid the next time the game opens and starts at a different base address.
					<br />

					<a name="2.details.finalizesigscan"> </a>
					<h3>FinalizeSigScan()</h3>
					Cleans up the memory used for the scanning when you are done.
					Always call this when your done scanning a module.
